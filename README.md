## 🧠 How the AI Works

The app uses machine learning for real-time fish recognition:

- **ONNX Runtime Web** - Runs neural network inference entirely in your browser
- **PyTorch-trained model** - Originally developed and trained using PyTorch
- **Instant feedback** - Classification happens with every brush stroke
- **Quality control** - Only validated fish can join the community tank

1. **Visit [FishArt.Online](https://fishart.online)**
2. **Start drawing** on the canvas (fish should face right!)
3. **Watch the AI** give feedback through background color changes
4. **Submit your fish** when you're happy with it
5. **See it swim** in the community tank with other creations
6. **Vote and explore** other artists' fish in the rankings

## Connected Repositories

### [fish-trainer](https://github.com/aldenhallak/fish-trainer)
- Contains the PyTorch code for training the fish doodle classifier.
- Exports the trained model to ONNX format, which is used by FishArt.Online for in-browser inference.
- Includes data augmentation, preprocessing, and model evaluation scripts.

### [fish-be](https://github.com/aldenhallak/fish-be)
- The backend for FishArt.Online, deployed as a serverless function (I'm using cloud run :~)).
- Handles fish image uploads, processes and stores submissions, and returns the canonical fish image for the tank.
- May also provide endpoints for moderation, stats, or gallery features.

## 📚 Documentation

Comprehensive documentation has been organized in the `docs/` folder:

- **[Deployment Guide](docs/deployment/)** - Setup, configuration, and deployment instructions
- **[Development Docs](docs/development/)** - Project structure, development guide, and model optimization
- **[Project Reports](docs/reports/)** - Updates, summaries, and optimization reports

## Setup & Deployment

For detailed setup instructions, see [docs/deployment/SETUP_GUIDE.md](docs/deployment/SETUP_GUIDE.md).

**Quick Start:**
1. Clone this repository.
2. Place the ONNX model (`fish_doodle_classifier.onnx`) in the project root directory.
3. Configure `src/js/firebase-init.js` if using Firestore for real-time features.
4. Deploy the static site (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, Firebase Hosting).
5. Ensure the backend endpoint in `src/js/fish-utils.js` points to the deployed `fish-be` instance.

See [DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/deployment/DEPLOYMENT.md) for advanced deployment options.

This repository was about ~80% AI generated. I used copilot + zencoder. Both tools worked great, but could not be trusted to make decisions on their own :)
